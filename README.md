**Internship Role: Data Analyst**

**Responsibilities:**

1. **Aggregating Vendor Master Data:** As a Data Analyst at CashFlo, I played a key role in aggregating master data for suppliers who are part of the supply chain process. This data was essential for identifying potential buyers who would benefit from CashFlo's products, such as dynamic discounting, for easier fulfillment. I meticulously compiled data from various sources and integrated them into a comprehensive Excel file.

2. **Aggregating Buyer Side Data:** Another significant aspect of my internship involved aggregating buyer-side data. This data was crucial in providing business opportunities to our dynamic discounting clients. I gathered buyer profiles, MCAs (Master Circulars of Accounts), GSTs (Goods and Services Tax), and credit rating data. This information assisted our credit and risk teams in making informed decisions during our go-live ventures.

3. **Invoice Aging Filter:** I also contributed to enhancing data analysis capabilities by adding an Invoice Aging Filter Excel sheet. This collaboration with the co-founder was for a specific client and involved ensuring that all fresh invoices were vetted and ready for discounting. I verified that there were no TDS (Tax Deductible At Source or Return TDS) transactions offsetting past invoices, ensuring seamless invoice discounting.
